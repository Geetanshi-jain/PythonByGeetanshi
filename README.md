## Basic Syntax
- **Literal Constants**: Fixed values like numbers, characters, and strings.
- **Numbers**: Includes integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers.
- **Variables and Basic Data Types**: Variables store data; data types include `int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`, etc.
- **String**: A sequence of characters. Strings are immutable in Python.
- **Escape Sequences**: Special characters used in strings, such as `\n` (new line) and `\t` (tab).
- **Operators and Expressions**: Arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment operators.
- **Evaluation Order**: Follows the rules of operator precedence.
- **Indentation**: Python uses indentation to define the block of code.
- **Input/Output Functions**: `input()` for reading data and `print()` for displaying data.
- **Comments**: Single-line (`#`) and multi-line comments (`'''...'''`).

## Conditional and Loop Statements
- **Conditional Statements**:
  - `if`, `if-else`, and `nested if-else` statements for decision making.
- **Iterative Statements**:
  - `for`, `while`, and nested loops for iteration.
- **Control Statements**:
  - `break`: Exit a loop prematurely.
  - `continue`: Skip the current iteration and continue with the next one.
  - `pass`: A null statement used as a placeholder.

## Functions and Sets
- **Functions**:
  - Creation of functions using the `def` keyword.
  - Function calling and parameter passing.
  - Lambda functions: Anonymous functions defined using `lambda` keyword.
- **Sets**:
  - Creating sets, adding and deleting elements.
  - Performing operations like union, intersection, and difference.

## Lists and Tuples
- **Lists**:
  - Creating and processing lists, using operators like `in` to find elements.
  - Using built-in functions like `len()`, `min()`, `max()`.
  - Copying lists using shallow or deep copy methods.
- **Tuples**:
  - Immutable sequences. Conversion between lists and tuples is possible.

## Introduction to Dictionaries
- **Dictionaries**:
  - Key-value pairs. Creating, processing, and modifying dictionaries.
  - Methods for adding, updating, and deleting dictionary elements.

## Class and Objects
- **Classes and Objects**:
  - Creation of classes and instantiation of objects.
  - Attributes and methods within a class.
  - Scopes, namespaces, and data hiding.
- **Inheritance**:
  - Creating subclasses and inheriting properties from a parent class.
- **Overloading and Overriding**:
  - Method overloading and method overriding for polymorphism.
- **Exception Handling**:
  - Handling errors using `try-except-finally` blocks.
  - Creating user-defined exceptions.

## File Handling and NumPy Library
- **File Handling**:
  - Opening, reading, writing, and closing files using Python's built-in file functions.
- **Regular Expressions**:
  - Pattern matching using the `re` module.
- **NumPy Library**:
  - Introduction to NumPy, creating arrays and matrices.
  - Performing operations on arrays and matrices using NumPy functions.
